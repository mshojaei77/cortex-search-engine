# Personal Search Engine

A privacy-focused, conversational AI-powered search engine that combines SearXNG with AI to deliver intelligent, synthesized results‚Äîno search engine API keys required.

This project is for anyone who wants to build a personalized, private search experience, create specialized AI research agents, or simply get straight answers without the noise of the modern web.

## Features

*   **Conversational Search**: Ask questions in natural language and get answers synthesized by a large language model.
*   **Private by Design**: Leverages a self-hosted SearXNG instance to protect your privacy. No tracking, cookies, or profiling.
*   **Local First**: The entire application runs locally on your machine.
*   **Extensible**: The modular design allows for easy extension and customization.
*   **Simple Setup**: Get up and running in minutes with Docker and a few simple commands.

## How It Works

The architecture is straightforward: your terminal interacts with a local Python application, which uses a local SearXNG instance (running in Docker) to fetch private search results. Those results are then synthesized by an AI model to give you a clean, coherent answer.

```

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Docker, Python 3.8+, and an OpenAI API Key.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-search-engine.git
cd personal-search-engine

# 2. Configure your API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" > .env

# 3. Setup and run
python setup.py && python main.py
```

## Future Directions

This project is a solid foundation for a more advanced research agent. Future development could include:

- [ ] **Agentic & Multi-Tool Workflows**: Evolve from a search assistant into a true agent. Grant it the ability to use other tools (like a calculator, code interpreter, or even call other APIs) and autonomously decide which tool to use for a given query.
- [ ] **Personalized Research Profiles**: Allow users to create distinct profiles for different research topics (e.g., "AI Developments," "Market Analysis") that prime the agent with specific contexts, preferred sources, and output formats.
- [ ] **Fully Local & Private AI**: Add first-class support for local LLMs via Ollama, enabling a 100% private, offline-capable version of the search engine.
- [ ] **Deep Research Agent Mode**: Create a mode where the agent can be given a topic to research autonomously. It would periodically search for new information, synthesize findings, and present a summary, acting as a personal intelligence briefing.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal Search**: Extend capabilities to understand and synthesize information from images, videos, and academic papers (PDFs).
- [ ] **Structured Data Extraction & Analysis**: Automatically extract and analyze structured data from web pages, such as tables or financial reports, and allow for direct querying and visualization.
- [ ] **Source Reliability**: Implement a system to automatically assess the reliability and potential bias of sources, providing users with a credibility score or warnings.
- [ ] **Automated Report Generation**: Create comprehensive reports in various formats (e.g., Markdown, PDF, Jupyter Notebooks) complete with citations, summaries, and visualizations.
- [ ] **Trend Analysis & Forecasting**: Monitor topics over time to identify emerging trends, predict future developments, and alert the user to significant changes or new publications.
- [ ] **Argument Mapping**: Deconstruct arguments from sources to identify premises, conclusions, and potential logical fallacies, presenting them in a structured, easy-to-understand format.
- [ ] **Seamless Note-Taking Integration**: Add one-click exporting of findings, summaries, and sources to popular note-taking applications like Obsidian, Logseq, and Notion.
- [ ] **Iterative, Multi-Stage Retrieval**: Implement a system that runs successive, automatically refined searches (keyword ‚Üí semantic ‚Üí citation-chaining) to surface high-quality primary sources instead of relying on one-shot queries.
- [ ] **Citation Extraction & Normalization**: Automatically pull canonical identifiers (DOI, arXiv ID, PMID, ISBN) and format them consistently for quick export to reference managers.
- [ ] **Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge Graph**: Connect concepts across different fields to suggest unexpected but relevant literature "bridges" that traditional search engines might miss.
- [ ] **Explainable Summarization**: Produce layered summaries (abstract, deep dive, bullet-point takeaways) with inline citations so users can decide what to read next based on their needs.
- [ ] **Interactive Query Refinement**: Offer smart prompts and visual sliders (date range, study type, source type) to let users steer their research without writing complex search strings.
- [ ] **Progress Tracking & Transparency**: Display a real-time sidebar showing every step of the research process as it happens, allowing users to track progress and understand the agent's reasoning.
- [ ] **Research Canvas & Audio Export**: Add one-click functionality to transform written research reports into interactive visual canvases or narrated audio summaries for different consumption styles.
- [ ] **Auto-Generated Data Visualizations**: Create interactive dashboards and charts from the researched data to help users quickly grasp trends, comparisons, and key metrics.
- [ ] **Self-Reflection Capabilities**: Implement an explicit self-reflection step where the agent evaluates if it has sufficient evidence before drafting conclusions, improving result quality.
- [ ] **Think vs. Instant Modes**: Add toggleable processing modes to let users choose between deeper, more thorough research (with longer wait times) or faster, more immediate results.
